# Credit Card Fraud Detection using ML (Random Forest & XGBoost)

This project detects fraudulent credit card transactions using two powerful machine learning models: **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**. The goal is to accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine, even with a highly imbalanced dataset.
